### Research Question

Which Quizzo locations are closest to the user based on location and day of week selected. 

### The Approach

We will be creating a dataset that includes Quizzo locations in Philadelphia, night of week that Quizzo is available at each location, and neighborhood.  We will use this data to create an interactive dashboard that the public can filter through and use to find Quizzo locations nearest to them on their desired date.
